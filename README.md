## Schedule

####Friday, November 7
In our first workshop, you will learn:
* **Normalize** - Browsers will render your CSS differently. To avoid this, it’s a good idea to use a modern alternative to a reset like Normalize.css, which will render elements more consistently cross-browser.
* **Organize** - It's a good practice to organize your CSS code to reflect the flow of your website’s layout.
* **Alphabetize** - Write your CSS properties in alphabetical order; it will help reduce the time it takes to find a specific property.

####Friday, November 14
In part two of our workshop you will learn:
* **Reuseable CSS** - DRY (Dont Repeat Yourself) up your code! Repeating yourself leads to huge CSS files and unnecessary code bloat. Take the time to plan out your elements in a simple and reusable way. Reuse your classes and tag on additional classes when needed.
* **Reducing Markup** - Remove unnecessary parent elements by iterating/refactoring often.
* **Naming Classes** - Write meaningful class names using BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) Methodology.

####Friday, November 21
In our last workshop, you will learn:
* **Sass/SCSS** - Overview of syntax and documentation.
* **Setup** - Project setup and imports.
* **Best Features** - Variables, nesting and mixins.
